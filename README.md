Trying to figure out a simple way to play HTML5 audio tag in multiple devices/browsers.

My goal is to play it on the following ones:

| Platform | Browser |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Desktop | Chrome 44 |
| Desktop | Firefox 31 |
| Desktop | IE 11 |
| Windows Phone | IE 11 |
| Android | Chrome |
| iOS | Safari |
